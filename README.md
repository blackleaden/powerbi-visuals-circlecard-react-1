![React Circle Card](./assets/screenshot.png)

This repository represents a simple way to use React for development of Power BI Custom Visuals. Circle Card shows singular value inside a circle. It supports basic visual settings (color and circle thickness) and adaptability to viewport size.

React-based Custom Visual development basics are explained in [this tutorial](https://microsoft.github.io/PowerBI-visuals/tutorials/building-react-based-custom-visual/getting-started/). It describes step-by-step creation of Circle Card. You're welcome to use that example as a base to your own Custom Visuals by cloning this repository or using `pbiviz new react` command of [Power BI Visuals Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerBI-visuals-tools).
